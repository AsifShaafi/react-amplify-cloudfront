## React Amplify CloudFront

This React website repo is made for a [Medium Post](https://bit.ly/3rtpKqi) that shows how to upload and publish your React website on AWS, which has low latency and is very cost-effective, using two common and popular AWS services, AWS Amplify and AWS CloudFront. 

This blog will also teach you how you can set up your own custom domain in AWS CloudFront and use that to show users your published React application.
